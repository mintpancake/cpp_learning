But one type of book that practically no
one  likes  to  read is a book about the
law.  Books  about the law are notorious
for being very long, very dull, and very
difficult  to  read.  This is one reason
many  lawyers  make  heaps of money. The
money    is    an   incentive-the   word
"incentive"   here   means  "an  offered
reward  to  persuade you to do something
you  don't  want  to  do"-to  read long,
dull,    and    difficult   books.   The
Baudelaire   children   had  a  slightly
different  incentive  for  reading these
books,  of  course.  Their incentive was
not heaps of money, but preventing Count
Olaf  from  doing  something horrible to
them in order to get heaps of money.
